Developed by Iker Llorens

I used Angular to create this simple web app. I developed it using the MVC model, I had a rough time getting the values from the response parsing the output of the API.

I considered that is useful for the user to see a live update of the webpage, however this could create unnecessary loads for the API. I focused on the functionality part of the app and not the style.

The app can be upgraded to include links to the articles and the images could be easily loaded.

As it ios made using Angular, the same service could provide to other modules in the app
